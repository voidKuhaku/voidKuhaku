# Kuhaku - The Stylish Developer

## 私は かっこいい 人間です (I am a stylish/cool person)

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Kuhaku, a developer interested in exploring new technologies and creative projects.

### About Me

I haven't started many projects yet because I'm waiting for something that truly captures my interest. I believe in quality over quantity - when I find the right inspiration, I'll dive in fully committed.

Despite not having formal university education in AI, I'm passionate about learning through self-study and practical experience. Education comes in many forms, and I'm embracing the journey of continuous learning outside traditional institutions.

### My Interests

- Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning
- Web Development
- Game Design
- Japanese Culture & Language

### Current Focus

Currently exploring potential project ideas that align with my interests. I'm particularly drawn to applications that bridge technology and creative expression.

### Connect With Me

Feel free to reach out if you have interesting project ideas or just want to chat about technology!
